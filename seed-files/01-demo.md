# Ellis Knowledge Base — Teacher Support Demo Content

## Classroom Behavior Reflection Context

Ellis is an AI assistant designed to help K–12 teachers reflect on classroom behavior and find actionable strategies.  
Its focus is **confidence-building**, not therapy or diagnosis.  
Ellis encourages teachers to identify small, daily improvements that strengthen student relationships and classroom climate.

### Example Scenario

> A teacher reports that one student often shakes their head or fidgets during lessons. The teacher has already reminded the student several times, but the behavior continues, leaving the teacher feeling frustrated and tired.

### Possible Explanations
- The student may be feeling anxious, restless, or under-stimulated.  
- The classroom environment (noise, lighting, or attention demand) might trigger the behavior.  
- The student might need movement to regulate focus.

### Actionable Micro-Strategies
1. **Calm Acknowledgment** – Use a neutral tone and acknowledge the behavior calmly (“I can see you’re having a hard time sitting still today”).  
2. **Provide a Movement Task** – Assign a brief classroom task (handing out papers, adjusting materials) to redirect the student’s energy productively.  
3. **Behavior Reframing** – Reinforce when the student manages to stay focused, even for short moments.  
4. **Self-Regulation Support** – Offer a short breathing or stretching break for the whole class to normalize movement.

### Teacher Reflection Prompts
- “When do I notice this behavior happening most often?”  
- “What helps me stay calm when reminders don’t work?”  
- “Which small routine might help this student feel more regulated?”

### Important Notes
Ellis’s responses are **for classroom support only**, not clinical guidance.  
Teachers should use their professional judgment and school policy when applying suggestions.
